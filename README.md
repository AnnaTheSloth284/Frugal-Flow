The owner of a local shop/market can list a percentage of ownership of the shop/market in the form of stocks. The initial price per stock is set by the market owner. The Proprietary Trading Platform(PTP) goes live for a certain period of time during the day. Buyers can place bids on stocks of interest. Once a bid is placed the price of the stock is raised to the new amount and a notification is sent to the owner of the stock, if the owner wishes to sell then the stock is sold to the buyer the money is sent to the PTP‚Äôs account where 0.02% of the selling price is taken as commission and the rest is sent to the account of the seller and an ownership certificate/document is sent to the new owner of the stock. If the owner does not wish to sell the stock at that price then the offer is rejected but the stock price remains the last quoted price. 

</br> In the scenario where stock is not sold within a specified period of time then the owner of the stock is notified of the progress of the stock and the owner can choose to decrease the stock price or to increase it or not. Once all the stocks are sold from the original owner, each buyer can hold onto the stock or sell it. If a new owner holds onto the stock for a prescribed period of time then he/she shall be eligible for the percentage cut of the stock from the total revenue of the shop/market. A new owner can then list the stock to be sold where new buyers can place bids on the stocks and notifications are sent to stock owners once a bid is placed. The app provides a tab where the owner can view the progress of the stocks as bids are placed the stock price rises and each new change in stock price causes the new stock price to be added to the graph showing growth or decline in stock.

</br> The owner of a stock can choose to hold a stock for a period of time where no buyer can bid on the stock but depending on the market the owner can choose to wish to sell or to keep holding. If an increase above a certain percentage in stock price is seen the the owner of the stock is notified about the change in stock price enabling the owner to set a new price to the stock so that he/she can sell it depending on the current market statistics.
